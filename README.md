# A Rock, Paper, Scissor Game.

This is a simple implementation of the classic hand game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Players choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The game follows these rules:

* Rock beats scissors
* Scissors beat paper
* Paper beats rock

It's a great example of decision-making and probability. Play against the computer and see if you can predict the outcome!
